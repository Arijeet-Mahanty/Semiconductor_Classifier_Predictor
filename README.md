# Semiconductor_Classifier_Predictor
In this project, I aimed to build a classifier to predict the Pass/Fail yield of semiconductor manufacturing process entities using sensor data. The dataset presented significant challenges, including high dimensionality (591 features) and a severe class imbalance between the "Pass" and "Fail" labels.
